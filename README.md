# A mini search engine!

## this project includes a web scraper to scrape a specific website for information (news in my case).
## it then processes this information into data ready for queries to be ran against it.
## using a simple web page that has a search bar the user enters in a query.
## through tf-idf weighting and cosine similarity the system ranks the top 10 "articles" closest to the users query with links to the actual web pages for said articles.
